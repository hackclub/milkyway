Notes on updating repo: 
    Still confused on what version of svelete
        check lockerfile 
    Use up-to-date versions of npm installs
    need to check the package-lock's so that the pnmp install, and make sure that vetsion conflicts dont exist

    __ does not exist on type 'Object'
    Parameter '__' implicitly has an 'any' type.
    gotta check other extensions/imports
