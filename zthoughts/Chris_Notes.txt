Notes for da tongue:

Imported ZOD 

FOR REVIEWER SYSTEMS:

Added airtable stuff :

Projects

    User - added new view(BlackholeSubmission) 
    BlackholeSubmissions - new table with fields
        submission_number
        User(from user table)
        username(from user table)
        Project(from projects table)
        Status (approved/rejected/pending)
        HackatimeHoursAtSubmission
        StellarshipsAtSubmission
        Reviewer(uhh probably gonna link this to user so auth works)
        Reason 

    
Added env variables:


Alright changes from here:

Note that soon once we get the basic net structure up we'll make 
it so that a slack bot works so that if a project is accepted/rejected 
reviewer feedback will go to the slack user of the project(a user's slack id is stored in airtable)

And to be clear what fields Projects tab and grid view of each project 
    user (link to user info view from user tab)
    projectid
    projectname(single line text)
    description(single line text)
    hackatimeprojects(single line text)
    hoursShipped(Lookup and is a number)
    status(single select)
        submitted
        wip
        completed
        second
    shipURL(URL)
    githubURL(URL)
    image(attachement)
    notMadeBy(single line text)
    howToPlay(single line text)
    addnComments(single line text)
    waitingReview(Rollup)
        rollup source = YSWS Project Submission
        field - AwardingResults(single line text)
    totalCoinsEarned(Rollup)
        rollup source = YSWS Project Submission
        field - coinsAwarded(number)


Fields from User tab and User Info view
    do later 

Blackhole review 
    Like the previous structure, get pending and see project info
    Approve or reject 

Basic review
    for each project, reviewers can pick from
    "this is a crazy good project, i really liked it!"
    "this is a good project that seems to have spent the number of hours stated"
    "i'm not too sure"
    "this does not feel like they spent the number of hours stated"
    and then if 2+ people vote 'crazy good', immediately issue 10 coins/hr(check hoursShippedx10 and add it to totalCoinsEarned(Rollup) then change status to finished)
    if 2+ people vote 'good' or 'crazy good', immediately issue 9 or 9.5 coins/hr(check hoursShippedx10 and add it to totalCoinsEarned(Rollup) then change status to finished)
    if any of the two bottom choices are chosen 2+ times, then it will be given second status and go to second review

Second review
    the second status projects will appear here 

Admin review 
    will do later 

The main goal is to get blackhole and basic reviews done
