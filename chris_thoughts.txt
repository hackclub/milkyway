Alright tongue if you're seeing this here's my general thoughts/things I noticied after working with yo milkyway
Why does svelete fight with me at every possible corner 

    Use up-to-date versions of npm installs

    Not sure oh how you're running things but i've got like 30 errors from stuff having the "any" type

Also added zod 
Need to double check where/how its used

admin emails are those with @hackclub.com in them, 
may just make it a field in the airtable if you get/need reviewers

MADE history + review, dont use em tho 

uhhh i made the backend blackhole like 3 times to make it work better 
i'm dead inside :D

time for another rework :sob:

IM AN IDIOT YIPPIEEEE

im gonna go crazy here 
especially since that THING SHOULD WORKED BUT OF COURSE IT DIDNT 

finally linked it sob
FINALLY IT HALF WORKS AOID HOASHNFUAF BAJ FK 
and i get more problems i wanna cry 

NEW AIRTABLE STUFF 
    User - added new view(BlackholeSubmission) 
    BlackholeSubmissions - new table with fields
        submission_number
        User(from user table)
        username(from user table)
        Project(from projects table)
        Status (approved/rejected/pending)
        CoinsSpent(10)
        CoinsBefore
        CoinsAfter
        HackatimeHoursAtSubmission
        StellarshipsAtSubmission
        Reviewer(uhh probably gonna link this to user so auth works)
        Reason 

Current reviewer page works so that the browser you use will be 
    marked as trusted (very basic rn will change it soon) 

need an env variable called REVIEWER_PASSWORD
    - Is the password for the reviewer page 

I'll make the system work so that we can use the airtable 
    field called "permissions" thats already made(gonna change the type tho) 

Now gonna make art :/

2 art pieces that I need to make 
    blackhole symbol(on the home page... idk make it a seperate tab instead?)
        probably below the referal pages would be best 
    blackhole background(well y'know what this is)

I'm gonna crash out 
    Why does clip studio do this to me tho 

need to check the package-lock's so that the pnmp install, and make sure that vetsion conflicts dont exist

i need to update the entire project so that it works on the most recent version of svelete...
    how many files are even in this project :sob:

after looking through there are two main problems:

    This kinda thing:
    __ does not exist on type 'Object'
    Parameter '__' implicitly has an 'any' type.

    OR:
    other extensions/import 

PHYSICS TEST LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
now need to ge the man stuff fixed
