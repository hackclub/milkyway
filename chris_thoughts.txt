Alright tongue if you're seeing this here's my general thoughts/things I noticied after working with yo milkyway
Why does svelete fight with me at every possible corner 

Use up-to-date versions of npm installs

Not sure oh how you're running things but i've got like 30 errors from stuff having the "any" type

Also added zod 
Need to double check where/how its used

admin emails are those with @hackclub.com in them, 
may just make it a field in the airtable if you get/need reviewers

MADE history + review, dont use em tho 

uhhh i made the backend blackhole like 3 times to make it work better 
i'm dead inside :D

time for another rework :sob:
